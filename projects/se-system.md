# SE Retail Management System

This is the final year project at my college, it researches a software engineering topic. Its full name is: **Retail Management System: A Case Study on Agile Development Methods**. It is definitely too long for a page title... :joy:

I wrote a 60-page thesis for this project, [contact me](mailto:billzhonggz@outlook.com) if you are interested in it.

I call this project "SE Retail Management" everywhere. The phrase "SE" comes from "[Social Enterprise](#social-enterprise)", the "customer" of this project. I was working with [Alan Hu](https://github.com/HuBeichen1), applying all we know about software engineering, and trying to make this system prefect.

## Background

The topic was raised half by myself, and half by my friend who owned a social enterprise at campus. He gave me a sketch of the system and I wanted to test the popular agile software development method.

We confirmed out topic with the instructor in March 2017, and began a research on agile methods.
