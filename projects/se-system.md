# SE Retail Management System

This is the final year project at my college, it researches a software engineering topic. Its full name is: **Retail Management System: A Case Study on Agile Development Methods**. It is definitely too long for a page title... :joy:

I wrote a 60-page thesis for this project, [contact me](mailto:billzhonggz@outlook.com) if you are interested in it.

I call this project "SE Retail Management" everywhere. The phrase "SE" comes from "[Social Enterprise](#social-enterprise)", the "customer" of this project. I was working with [Alan Hu](https://github.com/HuBeichen1), applying all we know about software engineering, and trying to make this system prefect.

## Background

The topic was raised half by myself, and half by my friend who owned a social enterprise at campus. He gave me a sketch of the system and I wanted to test the popular agile software development method.

We confirmed out topic with the instructor in March 2017, and began a research on agile methods.

### Social Enterprise

According to an article from the government of Hong Kong, “In general, a social enterprise is a business to achieve specific objectives such as providing services or product needed by the community [1].” Social enterprise was a live business my college. There were four social enterprises located at the campus when the project started. We choosed two of them to develop the system.

### Investgating Demands

Since this project has a topic of "software engineering", we began it from real demands. We did interviews with two shop managers, and found the following situations [2][3].

**Both of them were in retail business.** Two shops was selling different kinds of items. One sold fruits and packed food, the other sold used books.

**But the items they sold have different features.** This caused differences in their demands to the system. For fruit, weight units were always used to calculate prices but some system cannot accept floating numbers. For used books, each of them had a unique price tag base on its condition even they had same content.

**We had to do customization base on those features.**
