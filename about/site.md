# About This Site

I began set personal website in January 2015 when I firstly own this domain name.

## 2015 - 2017

During this stage, my website was hosted by [Aliyun](https://www.aliyun.com/), a large Chinese cloud service provider.

The website was configured using [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). WordPress is (one of) the most popular website framework. I think I don't need to introduce it.

## 2017 - 2018

The reason I hosted my website at Aliyun was because it offered a free plan of virtual host solution. As the plan expired, I had to find a place to host my website. At this moment, I found a static generator, then host the site on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

### Hexo

Instead of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the first static generator I found was [Hexo](https://hexo.io/). I believe it was because I was looking for Chinese documents when I tried to reach it. Hexo was created by a Chinese, so it has a excellent support to Chinese.

From time to time I use my homepage as a blog until I recently splitted blog and main page. Hexo provides a migrate tool which allows me transfer articles from WordPress to Hexo. So my web site begins to be hosted by GitHub Pages.

### Spilt Repositories

I spiltted my blog and main page around April 2018. I made a "main page" to show off myself by hand (using Bootstrap), and the blog went to a subdirectory by configurating GitHub Pages.

## Now: VuePress

It was very inconvenient to write raw HTML and the template I used was not good enough for showing articles and lists. After some simple tests, I finally chose [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) to generate my homepage from Markdown articles.

The reason I choose VuePress is simple. It is simple, and, I have been used [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) a lot in the [SE Retail Management](/projects/se-system.html) project.

So that's what you can see now.
