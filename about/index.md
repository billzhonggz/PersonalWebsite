I always believe I can be someone who makes contributions to applications of advanced technologies in the real world. Why? The story should begin in 2004...

## Computer Enthusiast

The story begins with a book *Computer Handbook*. I believe it was published around 2000 and that was the first time I touched a "professional" computer book. I remember the book was brought from a local store at Huanghuagang, Guangzhou by my father. And the book ranged from PC components to troubleshooting. I began to read this 1000-page book and to know what made a computer and how could a computer work.

After that, I read a biography of Bill Gates, the guy who founded Microsoft. That was where my English came from. (Not funny at all, right? :)).

I tried to keep my interest in computers till now. At those days Internet was not so developed (my family was using ADSL), I get my updates mainly from newspapers and magazines. I think I have caught the failure of Windows Vista and Windows 8, the popularizing of SATA 6Gbps and USB 3.0. Then was the beginning of Cloud Computing, which began from PaaS in China, I believe.

## Metro, Railway, Buses, and I

It seems to be funny. How can an IT nerd have relationships with those transportation tools?

People in the city I live always concern a lot on their "home". In 2010, I was in middle school, and the city was busy on preparing the 16th Asian Games. I don't even remember the exact day but I found a forum call [Ditiezu](http://www.ditiezu.com/). On that forum, people gather and discuss all subjects about metro. Because of the Asian Games, the city I live in would soon launch several new metro routes, people were excited and just posted a lot of posts to the forum. I joined the discussion and it was the beginning of my interest in public transportation.

Public transportation is a big topic. It relates to interests of both public and authorities from my "adult's" point of view. But in fact, I set up my own understanding of the word "citizenship" exactly from my interest in public transportation. From public transportation, I can link it to the places inside the city, from the reason of the route setting, I may think about urban governance and planning.

## Combine Them Together!

Gradually, I had my own emotion towards the city I live in. I begin to consider whether there can be something I can contribute to my hometown.

Maybe combine my two interests together is a good option.

That's the reason why I want to do something on applications of technologies.
